# MB-RRL2 
### a library for model-based relational reinforcement learning

Forked from: [https://gitlab.tubit.tu-berlin.de/shoefer/mbrrl2](https://gitlab.tubit.tu-berlin.de/shoefer/mbrrl2)

mbrrl2 is a fork of [libPRADA](http://userpage.fu-berlin.de/tlang/prada/)

#### Main features of this fork

- New object-oriented interface of the relational rule learner
- Task-sensitive learning as presented in [1]
- Incremental rule learning
- Several bugfixes

### Requirements

The new rule learner interface requires boost. If you don't want to use it
set ``RULELEARNER2 = 0`` in the ``make-config`` file in the root directory.

### Installation

Please type ``make`` in the root directory.
Then, try out the demos in ``mbrrl2/test``.

New demos are

- ``test/incremental`` (showing how to use incremental rule learning)
- ``test/tasksensitive_example`` (showing a the task-sensitive cost function presented in [2])

To understand the main features of this library, please read the guide: ``doc/guide.pdf``
